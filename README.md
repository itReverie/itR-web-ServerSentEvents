# ServerSentEvents

Sample of server sent events with html5 and php. 

OfficeWidgets.php
The three widgets at the top are populated based on a server event sent every 60secs, for the purpose of this excercise the data is an array. 

OfficeWidgets.js
▲ and ▼ are just indicators compared to the previous data. 
For example: 
If there are more cups of coffee than before or if the temperature has increased or decresead compared to the previous update. 

Based on the variables at the top the office mood changes, that logic is in javascript.
For example: 
If there isn't coffee the office is not happy :( 
If the temperature is below 15 the office is not happy :( 
Otherwise they are happy :)
